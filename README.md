# **Contamination in Mammoth aDNA Through Time**

This project is aimed to identify trends in contamination of nucleic acid sequences extracted from natural history collection specimens through time. 
To address this, we will first analyze mammoth (_Mammuthus_) raw sequence data chronologically to identify contaminant DNA. 
Mammoths have been studied for decades and have a high-quality reference genome, making them a useful study organism for this purpose. 
In order to compare Mammoth sequence contamination to a control, we will be use modern elephants (_Loxodonta_) as a control.
We use the metagenomic Kraken2 pipeline to identify the taxonomic affinity of reads published from mammoths between different studies. 

We seek to uncover potential sources of contamination, which could influence the accuracy and reliability of ancient DNA findings, 
and to identify whether sources of contamination have changed over time across studies.
